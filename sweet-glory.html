    <p class="notes"><strong>notes:</strong><br><br> sososo incredibly aesthetic !!! this cafe is has really cute for
        instagram pics, and the vibes are really nice. you can tell the crepe cakes are beautifully made, with distinct
        layers and fillings. the matcha crepe tasted really matcha-y and i liked the extra powder sprinkled on top.
        however, i think the drinks (specifically the matcha) were too sweet. this led the matcha flavor to be
        overpowered by syrup. if you were to come here, i would stick to the crepe cakes. note, they are a
        electronics-free cafe.<br><br>
