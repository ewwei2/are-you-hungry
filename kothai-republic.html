    <p class="notes"><strong>notes:</strong><br><br> a really cute brunch spot! the food was nicely plated, and the
        interior was very clean and woody. the menu itself is a modern take on asian flavors, which i think they did
        successfully. i got the fluffy cakes, only available on weekends. the name speaks for it, the cakes were fluffy
        and not too sweet. i only took a star off because it was pretty expensive for what it is: pancakes. my friend’s
        kfc sandwich had a much bigger portion size. <br><br>
