    <p class="notes"><strong>notes:</strong><br><br> my FAVORITE korean spot in sf, and one of my favorite restaurants
        in general. toyose is a homey and cozy garage that serves the best korean food. the kimchi fried rice has a
        runny egg yolk, chef’s kiss. the corn cheese has the BEST cheese pulls #devoured. and of course, the stews leave
        me and my friends in food comas every single time. we end up having days left of leftovers to eat and enjoy. i
        will say the line is really long, but they are open till 12am on weekdays, and 2am on weekends! <br><br>
