    <p class="notes"><strong>notes:</strong><br><br>a solid matcha cafe! their matcha is rich and green, but i think they do their add ons better than the matcha itself. the strawberry puree is perfectly sweet and the sea salt is also really yummy! but the star of the show is truly their japanese sandos. the katsu one is perfectly filling and amazing, but the fruit ones are sweet and soft as well. the bread is fluffy like a cloud, and the creme is equally as fluffy and smooth. they also have two locations, one in the mission and one in the marina. i do prefer the marina one because it was seating, possibly a good study spot?<br><br>
        <strong>favorites:</strong><br><br>🤍 katsu sando <br>🤍 iced sea salt matcha latte <br></p>
