    <p class="notes"><strong>notes:</strong><br><br> the cutest packaging ever !!! this cafe has hand drawn
        illustrations on the boxes, i got cute lil christmas cats. the interior is really aesthetic too, a bit boho?
        this can also be a study spot, since they have free wifi and plenty of seating. this was my first time having a
        croffle, and i really liked the crispy bread and the soft creme on top. it was the perfect amount of sweetness.
        my only complaint, i wish the matcha was stronger and whisked better...<br><br>
        <strong>favorites:</strong><br><br>🤍 strawberry creme cheese croffle <br>🤍 guava nectar juice <br></p>
