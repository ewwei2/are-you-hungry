    <p class="notes"><strong>notes:</strong><br><br> this was one of my first dessert cafes i stumbled upon in sf. it's
        really aesthetic and fancy, good for nice occasions like birthdays and celebrations! their bingsu flavors are
        asian inspired, like ube and hojicha which can't be found in other places in the city. i will say it is quite
        expensive for what it is (which is why i took off a star), but you can share with friends!<br><br>
        <strong>favorites:</strong><br><br>🤍 matcha lava cake <br>🤍 pandan crepe cake <br>🤍 ube biscoff bingsu</p>
